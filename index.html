        <div class="item">4. Because satire used to be great.</div>
        Satire used to be a <i>real</i> art form. From Aristophanes to Swift, satire used to be  a way to truly <i>engage</i> with the intellectual. Who can deny the brilliance of <i>A Modest Proposal</i>? Jonathan Swift told people to <i>eat babies</i> and some idiots thought he was serious! <i>Really?</i>
        <br />
        <div class="image"><img src="jSwift.jpg" /><br />Seriously guys. Eat babies." - J. Swizzle</div>
        That's funny. Eating babies. That's hilarious. That's <i>real</i> satire. <br />
        Or all of the penis jokes in <i>Lysistrata</i>. Penises are funny. Masculinity is funny. That's funny. That's <i>real</i> satire.
        <div class="image"><img src="phallus.jpg" /><br />The greeks actually wore penis costumes that basically looked like this. <i>That's</i> good satire.</div>
        <div class="item">3. Because satire today is immature crap.</div>
        Why is South Park consistently one of the most watched TV shows? Anyone who thinks South Park is "real" satire has clearly never read any <i>real</i> satire. South Park is just a bunch of upper middle class white men making offensive jokes. What's so "deep" about that? 
        <div class="image">"F--- your f---ing face, uncle-f---er."</div>
        This is the level of humor than we can expect from a modern "satire" if we can even call it that. Seriously, I don't know if this can even be called "satire" any more.
        <div class="item">2. Because this image is on point.</div>
        <div class="image"><img src="whatHappened.png" style="width: 80% !important"/></div>
        <div class="item">1. Because Youtube comments knows what's up.</div>
        <div class="image"><img src="yt.png" style="width: 80% !important"/><br /> Hell yeah.</div>
